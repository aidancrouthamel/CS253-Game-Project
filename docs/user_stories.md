As a player, I want an endless game in which surviving longer leads to a higher score. This type of game is simple enough that many people will be able to play. More specifically, in the game, the user will control a spaceship that will need to avoid meteors. 

In addition, when the game ends, the user's name and score will be inserted into a database. Data will be retreived from the database in order to display a leaderboard. The main page of the site will display the ten highest scores, and there will also be a leaderboard page listing a larger amount of the scores.
