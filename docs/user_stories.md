Game: let's vote on which game we want to make, e.g Tetris, some version of Geometry Dash or Flappy Bird, e.t.c.

Basically some type of game that the longer you are able to survive, the higher your score. Those are normally simple but really addictive 

Single player game preferably for simplicity, but we can spice it up and make it multiplayer

Game should allow users to sign in. Preferably should not require users to sign in before playing, but should allow them to sign in, 
so if they have a highscore, it gets recorded under their account

Game should at least store each player's highscores, and the overall best score. (We can spice it up and make a leaderboard if we have time ðŸ”¥)
