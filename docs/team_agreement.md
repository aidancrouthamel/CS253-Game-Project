Instead of having a rotating leader, we have responsibilities assigned to each team member. 
Alex: Responsible for general flask app and html/css design
Aidan: Responsible for anything database related
Rose: Responsible for creating game assets
Rees: Responsible for the game that will be embedded in the center of the index page

Decisions will be made by group consensus. It is not necessary to attend every meeting; however, each group member should make sure to communicate with the rest of the group in order for every group member to have a good idea of everyone else's progress.

For in person meetings, we will meet at dugout. We will use a discord server as our main method of communication outside of meetings.
